# Rock Paper Scissors Project
### Rock Paper Scissors Project | The Odin Project | Foundations

This is the first JavaScript project within "The Odin Project".

The main goal of this project is to demonstrate basic usage of JavaScript within a webpage.

**Skills demonstrated: Basic HTML, basic CSS, basic Javascript.**

### **Note:**

This project includes some styling to polish some CSS knowledge and learn the interaction between JavaScript and CSS [^1].

As mentioned, the main intent of the project is to demonstrate basic JavaScript knowledge and how to integrate it into a webpage, therefore, it's is not my intent to go overboard with page styling (even though I might have :disappointed_relieved:).

At a later stage, when I learn more advanced CSS techniques; I might update this project to include some animations and polish the overall look of the page.

[^1]: The project itself only required the very basic game function; it was my own idea to add the CSS to ensure my CSS skills stay sharp during the JavaScript portion of the "Foundation" course (which doesn't include much, if any, CSS).
