# Rock Paper Scissors Project
### Rock Paper Scissors Project | The Odin Project | Foundations

This is the first JavaScript project within "The Odin Project".

The main goal of this project is to demonstrate basic usage of JavaScript within a webpage.

**Skills demonstrated: Basic HTML, basic CSS, basic Javascript.**

**Webpage responsiveness: THIS PROJECT WILL NOT DISPLAY PROPERLY ON A MOBILE PHONE.**

### **Note:**

At a later stage, when I learn more advanced CSS techniques; I might update this project to include some animations and polish the overall look of the page (and most importantly, create a responsive design).
